					"ROBOPSYCHOLOGIST\r\nDr. Susan Calvin had seen it all when it came to robots. As a girl she had seen the early models -- mute and totally faithful. She joined U.S. Robots and Mechanical Men, Inc. when they began adapting Earth robots for work in space -- and Earth men for work with the strictly logical robots!\r\n\r\nShe had driven the first -- and only -- mind-reading robot out of its mind, and coaxed the childlike Brain to invent the interstellar engine.\r\n\r\nFinally, at the end of her career, she faced the final question: who was really in charge; and who should be?\r\n\r\nIN THESE STORIES OF THE EARLY DAYS OF ROBOTS, ISAAC ASIMOV ESTABLISHED THE THREE LAWS OF ROBOTICS AND DEMONSTRATED THE ABILITIES THAT HAVE MADE HIM ONE OF THE WORLD'S LEADING SCIENCE FICTION WRITERS.\r\n--back cover",
