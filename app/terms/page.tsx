			<h2 id="user-content">User content</h2>
			<p>
				We do not own any data, information or material (collectively, “Content”) that you submit on the Website in the

				Without limiting any of those representations or warranties, we have the right, though not the obligation, to,
				in our own sole discretion, refuse or remove any Content that, in our reasonable opinion, violates any of our
				policies or is in any way harmful or objectionable. Unless specifically permitted by you, your use of the
				Website and Services does not grant us the license to use, reproduce, adapt, modify, publish or distribute the
				Content created by you or stored in your user account for commercial, marketing or any similar purpose.

				and we do not warrant the offerings of, any businesses or individuals or the content of their resources. We do
				not assume any responsibility or liability for the actions, products, services, and content of any other third
				parties. You should carefully review the legal statements and other conditions of use of any resource which you

				actions, disputes, or demands asserted against any of them as a result of or relating to your Content, your use
				of the Website and Services or any willful misconduct on your part.

			<h2 id="severability">Severability</h2>
			<p>
				All rights and restrictions contained in this Agreement may be exercised and shall be applicable and binding
				only to the extent that they do not violate any applicable laws and are intended to be limited to the extent
				necessary so that they will not render this Agreement illegal, invalid or unenforceable. If any provision or
				portion of any provision of this Agreement shall be held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable by a court of
				competent jurisdiction, it is the intention of the parties that the remaining provisions or portions thereof
				shall constitute their agreement with respect to the subject matter hereof, and all such remaining provisions or
				portions thereof shall remain in full force and effect.

				The formation, interpretation, and performance of this Agreement and any disputes arising out of it shall be
				governed by the substantive and procedural laws of Missouri, United States without regard to its rules on
				conflicts or choice of law and, to the extent applicable, the laws of United States. The exclusive jurisdiction
				and venue for actions related to the subject matter hereof shall be the courts located in Missouri, United
				States, and you hereby submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts. You hereby waive any right to a jury
				trial in any proceeding arising out of or related to this Agreement. The United Nations Convention on Contracts
				for the International Sale of Goods does not apply to this Agreement.
